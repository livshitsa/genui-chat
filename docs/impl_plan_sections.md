 The implementation plans follow this pattern:

  1. References - Table with relevant documents
  2. Scope - Brief statement of what's being implemented
  3. Current State Analysis - Tables showing existing components and their status
  4. Gap Analysis - What's missing (optional but helpful)
  5. Implementation Phases - Detailed breakdown by phase with:
    - Reference to epic story
    - Objective
    - Files to Create/Modify tables
    - Code specifications/examples
    - Acceptance Criteria from the story
  6. File Summary - Two tables (Files to Create, Files to Modify)
  7. Implementation Order - Visual diagram showing dependencies
  8. Testing Checklist - By phase
  9. Risk Mitigation - Table
  10. Effort Estimate - Table with story points
